    "\n",
    "One of the business innovations in retail is to find associations or relationships between products from sales transaction data that aims to:\n",
    "<br>-bundled and sold together.\n",
    "<br>-give someone a product recommendation.\n",
    "<br>-putting together a display rack.\n",
    "<br>-compiling e-commerce product pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this aims to increase sales while solving inventory problems - because products that don't sell well if paired correctly will be more attractive and will most likely be bought in one package. This process is an analysis process called Market Basket Analysis (MBA).\n",

The \"strong\" relationship here will be seen based on the proportion of the number of occurrences of the product combination to be bundled with the whole transaction.\n",
    "\n",
